# Cesar algorithm example in DenoJS

## **Description:**
Many people wants to learn criptography, but the main concept that you must to learn is the cesar algorithm.
It did aprox 2000 years a go, by the romans,ItÂ´s very simple to learn a easy to replicate in the modern programming languages.

## **Run this example**
> **Note:** you must have installed [DenoJS](https://deno.land/manual@v1.36.1/getting_started/installation) in your system
Run the following commands after install Deno:

```
cd ./<working directory>
```

```
deno run -A cesar.js
```

## **Contributing**
Yeah, you can add more complex capabilities to this program like:
* Number compatibility
* Another alphabets compability
* recreate the functionality of [the enigma machine](https://youtu.be/G2_Q9FoD-oQ) or create your own encryption system.
